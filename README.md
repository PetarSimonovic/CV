| **Sloth** is a mobile pedometer game designed to make walking fun: if a player beats their daily step count they receive a new sloth with a distinct personality; if they miss the step count they lose a sloth. Negative sloths will attempt to guilt trip the player into walking, while positive sloths will offer encouragement. Neutral sloths will dispense sloth-related facts. The app was created as a Makers Academy group project and developed using JavaScript, React Native and Expo. It was tested with Jest. <br/>https://github.com/PetarSimonovic/Guilt_Trip| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69108995/114376935-05c65280-9b7e-11eb-8808-ea5a386f7af6.png)|
| **Log-Line** is an iOS app that generates story synopses which can be used as prompts for writers of fiction. It was initially written as a web app in JavaScript, then redeveloped in Swift and Xcode with additional functionality. The app randomly generates its synopses but users can tap on nouns, verbs and adjectives to "lock" them into the story synopsis, allowing writers to fine-tune the narrative. The app will also periodically present users with a synopsis of a classic film or novel and ask them to guess the title. Log-Line was designed and developed as a solo project. <br/>https://github.com/PetarSimonovic/Log-Line-Swift |![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69108995/114375060-34dbc480-9b7c-11eb-90fe-cf64fb60b524.png)|

|**Poke** is a Facebook-inspired social messaging platform on which users can post their thoughts, and like and comment on posts. It was built in Ruby on Rails as part of a Makers Academy group project. Our team adopted an Agile development process and worked in two-day sprints. We alternated roles so that each team member took on the position of leader, scrum master, scribe, challenger and technician. Poke was developed with continuous integration/deployment using CircleCI and Heroku.<br/> https://github.com/PetarSimonovic/acebook-poke  <br /> https://gentle-beach-18739.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69108995/114376682-c5ff6b00-9b7d-11eb-97dc-80ee6852be33.png)|
