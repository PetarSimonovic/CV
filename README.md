| Sloth | Sloth is a mobile pedometer game designed to make walking fun: if a player beats their daily step count they receive a new sloth with a distinct personality; if they miss the step count they lose a sloth. Negative sloths will attempt to guilt trip the player into walking, while positive sloths will offer encouragement. Neutral sloths will dispense sloth-related facts. The app was created as a Makers Academy group project and developed using React Native and Expo. It was tested in Jest. <br/>https://github.com/PetarSimonovic/Guilt_Trip| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69108995/114376935-05c65280-9b7e-11eb-8808-ea5a386f7af6.png)|
| Log-Line | Log-Line is an iOS app which generates story synopses that can be used as prompts for writers of fiction. It was initially written as a web app in JavaScript, then redeveloped in Swift and Xcode with additional functionality: users can tap on words to "lock" them into the story synopsis, allowing writers to fine-tune the narrative. The app will also periodically present users with a synopsis of a classic film and ask them to guess the title. Log-Line was developed as a solo project. <br/>https://github.com/PetarSimonovic/Log-Line-Swift |![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69108995/114375060-34dbc480-9b7c-11eb-90fe-cf64fb60b524.png)|

It was developed as a solo project in JavaScript with Three.js, and deployed to Heroku.<br/> https://github.com/PetarSimonovic/archipelago <br/> https://warm-escarpment-84694.herokuapp.com|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69108995/114375961-1c1fde80-9b7d-11eb-91d5-12517e490119.png)  |
|Poke| Poke is a Facebook-inspired social messaging platform, on which users can post their thoughts, and like and comment on posts. It was developed in Ruby on Rails as part of a Makers Academy group project for which we adopted an Agile development process and worked in two-day sprints. We alternated roles among the team so that each member took on the position of leader, scrum master, scribe, challenger and technician. Poke was developed with continuous integration/deployment using CircleCI and Heroku.<br/> https://github.com/PetarSimonovic/acebook-poke  <br /> https://gentle-beach-18739.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69108995/114376682-c5ff6b00-9b7d-11eb-97dc-80ee6852be33.png)|
