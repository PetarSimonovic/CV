| Sloth | A mobile pedometer game to make walking fun: if a player beats their daily step count they receive a new sloth with a distinct personality; if they miss the step count they lose a sloth. Negative sloths will attempt to guilt trip the player into walking, while positive sloths will offer encouragement. Neutral sloths will dispense sloth-related facts. A Makers Academy group project developed using React Native and Expo. Tested in Jest.<br/>https://github.com/PetarSimonovic/Guilt_Trip| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69108995/114373847-eb3eaa00-9b7a-11eb-801b-5630451e72fd.png)|
